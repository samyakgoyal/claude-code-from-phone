# Contributing

Welcome! And thank you for being here instead of doing whatever you're supposed to be doing right now.

This project is a guide for running [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) from your phone — because sometimes you need to ship code from the grocery store, and nobody should judge you for that.

## How to contribute

**Found a bug or have a suggestion?** Open an issue. Describe what's wrong or what you'd like to see. Screenshots from your phone are extra credit.

**Want to fix something or add a platform guide?** Open a PR. Keep it focused — one change per PR, like one exercise per set.

### Tested on a platform we didn't cover?

Write a section and PR it. Android, iPad, a Steam Deck — we don't care what device, as long as it works and you can explain it clearly. Bonus points if you tested it somewhere ridiculous.

### Found a typo?

Fix it. No issue needed. We trust you.

Seriously, just open a PR. Life is too short for process around typo fixes.

## Code style

Keep it simple. This is a single HTML file, not a React app. If your PR adds a `node_modules` folder, we need to talk.

- Write like a human, not a textbook
- If a sentence can be shorter, make it shorter
- Test your changes by opening `index.html` in a browser

## That's it

No CLA. No lengthy code review process. No mandatory 47-step checklist. Just be kind, keep it useful, and maybe don't submit PRs from bed at 2 AM. Or do. We're not your parents.
